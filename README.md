This is my 3rd Task in SkillCraft Technologies Web Development Internship.
I created a Tic-Tac-Toe web application that lets users play against each other or the computer, with features to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions.
The app's design is styled with CSS, while JavaScript manages the game logic for a smooth and interactive experience.
